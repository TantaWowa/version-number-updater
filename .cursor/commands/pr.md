PR Creator
Update changes from the current branch to the target branch. Generate a GitHub pull request with a semantic title and structured body, then create the PR using the GitHub CLI (gh).

Use Grok 4 Fast model for precise diff analysis.
Title: Follow conventional commits (<type>(<scope>): <description>, max 72 chars). Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test. Scope: Relevant module/file (e.g., auth, ui, api).
Body: Include sections:
Summary: 1-2 sentences on what changed.
Impact: User/system effects (e.g., "Speeds login by 30%").
Tests: Added tests or coverage (e.g., "Unit tests, 95% coverage").
Risks: Potential issues (e.g., "Edge case in token expiry").
Reviewers: Suggest 1-2 team members for the --assignee flag (default: team@yourco.com).


Keep body <500 words, Markdown-formatted for GitHub.

After generating the PR content, create the PR using:
```
gh pr create --title "TITLE" --body "BODY" --assignee USER1,USER2
```

Additional options:
- `--draft`: Create as draft PR
- `--label "label1,label2"`: Add labels
